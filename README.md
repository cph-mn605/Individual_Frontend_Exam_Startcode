# This repository includes our frontend for our start code for the coming term project

* The frontend includes a feature where we can login using our login endpoint implemented in our backend code. In the header you can see a page for the user and the admin, but you canâ€™t see the content before you login. 
* Here you can log in to the website with a username and password for either user or admin. 
* When you have logged in as a user, you can still not see the content of the admin and the other way around. 


To start the project in Visual studios, use:
* npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3
* npm install react-router-dom@5.3.0
* npm install uuid
